Assistant: 
Hello! I’d be happy to help.  
Please tell me a bit more about your project:

1. What the application should do (main features or user stories).  
2. Whether it is a command-line tool, desktop GUI, web service, mobile app, etc.  
3. Any performance, scalability or deployment constraints you already know of.  
4. What kind of data you will store or process (e.g., text, images, video, sensor streams).  
5. Any particular libraries, frameworks, or programming styles you prefer or wish to avoid.

With those details I can suggest a suitable architecture, Python libraries, and an implementation roadmap.

==== Message #3 ====
User: 
So I want to make a headless tool which runs on my linux server. I want it to connect to discord and run a bot which i can DM links to news articles. I then want it to download the news article and parse information out of it using a local LLM which I have setup with ollama. I'm not set on exactly using ollama if that's too restrictive and can switch to other self hosting options if needed.

Anyways I want the system to analyise the paragraphs in the article comparing it to the headline + the context gathered from the previous paragraphs. I don't want the LLM to give a summary but rather give a sentiment rating and a relevence rating. The a copying program exports the most relevant paragraphs to a website which allows me to view the news article with the relevant paragraphs highlighted (with rating value) + expected sentiment

is this possible? I don't want you to write any code just give suggestions for libraries and how I could make this project possible 

kotlin.Unit

==== Message #4 ====
Assistant: 
Yes, this is very doable on a Linux server with only open-source components.  
Below is a practical, battle-tested stack and an implementation outline you can follow.

---

## 1. High-level architecture

```
Discord DM  ──▶  Bot listener  ──▶  Article fetcher & cleaner
                                        │
                                        ▼
                               Paragraph segmentation
                                        │
                                        ▼
                ┌───────────────────────┴───────────────────────┐
                │                   NLP core                    │
                │   − relevance scoring   − sentiment scoring   │
                └───────────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                                        │
                                        ▼
                              Result persister (DB / JSON)
                                        │
                                        ▼
                                Mini web viewer
```

Everything can run inside one Python process (async) or be split into micro-services later if you need scale.

---

## 2. Suggested libraries / tools

| Concern | Recommended option | Why |
|---------|-------------------|-----|
| Discord bot | **discord.py 2.x** (async) | Mature, well-documented, runs headless. |
| HTTP / article download | `httpx` (async) | Non-blocking; plays well with discord.py’s event loop. |
| Article extraction & clean HTML → plain text | **trafilatura** or **newspaper3k** | Handles boiler-plate removal, encoding, language detection. |
| Paragraph splitting | Built-in `re` / `textwrap`, or `spacy`’s `Doc.sents` for sentence boundaries then `nltk`/custom to group into paragraphs. |
| Sentence & paragraph embeddings | **sentence-transformers** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, `bge-base-en`, etc.) | Fast, lightweight, good quality relevance scores, runs on CPU if needed. |
| Relevance metric | cosine similarity (`scipy.spatial.distance.cosine`). |
| Sentiment classifier | ① Hugging Face model (`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`) for speed, or ② your local LLM via **ollama**/`llama.cpp` doing zero-shot classification (“Positive/Negative/Neutral”). |
| Local LLM bridge | If you stay with Ollama: `ollama-python` (simple REST wrapper). For raw `llama.cpp`: `ctransformers` or `llama-cpp-python`. |
| Persistence | SQLite (with `peewee` or SQLModel) or a plain JSON/Parquet dump—depends on volume. |
| Web viewer | Tiny **Flask** or **FastAPI** backend + **Jinja2** templates. Highlight paragraphs with `mark.js` or a CSS heatmap class. |
| Background / service manager | `systemd` unit or `supervisor` to keep the bot alive on reboot. |

All of the above are pip-installable; no extra package manager required.

---

## 3. Implementation roadmap

1. **Discord bot skeleton**  
   • Create a bot token in the Discord Developer portal.  
   • `discord.py` async listener for direct messages containing URLs.  
   • Validate URL, enqueue a job.

2. **Fetching & cleaning**  
   • Use `httpx.AsyncClient` to get the HTML.  
   • Run `trafilatura.extract(html, include_comments=False)` to obtain title + main text.  
   • Split into paragraphs (`"\n\n"` or regex on double line breaks).

3. **Relevance scoring**  
   • For each paragraph *pₖ*:  
     – Build context string = headline + “ ” + concatenation of previous paragraphs (optionally capped length).  
     – Compute embeddings with `sentence-transformers`.  
     – Relevance = 1 – cosine_distance(context, paragraph).  
   • Keep the score 0–1 (or 0–100).

4. **Sentiment scoring** (pick one)  
   a. Fast classifier: Hugging Face sentiment model (`pipeline("sentiment-analysis")`).  
   b. LLM: prompt your local model:  
      “Classify the sentiment of this paragraph as Positive / Negative / Neutral.”  
      Parse the answer.

5. **Data model**  
   ```
   Article(id, url, headline, fetched_at)
   Paragraph(id, article_id→Article, index, text,
             relevance_score, sentiment_label)
   ```
   A SQLite file is fine.

6. **Web viewer**  
   • `/article/<id>` endpoint renders headline + paragraphs.  
   • Each `<p>` gets a CSS class representing relevance heat colour (green → yellow → red).  
   • Tooltip or badge with numerical score + sentiment label.

7. **Deployment**  
   • Put the bot and the web server in a single `uvicorn` process (FastAPI) or separate processes.  
   • Create a `systemd` service file pointing to `python -m mybot`. Enable & start.

---

## 4. Notes & alternatives

• Instead of custom relevance logic you could leverage an LLM prompt:  
  “Rate how relevant this paragraph is to the headline on a 0-10 scale.”  
  but embedding similarity is cheaper and deterministic.

• If you prefer an “orchestration” layer, **LangChain** or **Haystack** can chain fetch → clean → embed → rank, but for a small tool plain code is simpler.

• On CPU-only servers MiniLM embedding ≈ 1 ms per paragraph; RoBERTa sentiment ≈ 10 ms. Plenty fast unless you stream hundreds of articles per minute.

• Store raw HTML too; you can later tweak parsing without re-downloading.

• Add caching to avoid re-processing the same URL.

---

## 5. Next steps

1. Spin up a Python 3.11 virtual environment, install:  
   `pip install discord.py[voice] httpx trafilatura sentence-transformers scipy transformers torch fastapi uvicorn[standard]`  
   (Adjust optional GPU / CPU extras.)

2. Prototype the article pipeline offline with a sample URL.

3. Wire the pipeline into the Discord listener.

4. Build the simple Flask / FastAPI template for visualisation.

Once you have each module working in isolation, glue them together and harden (logging, error handling, retries). The entire MVP can fit comfortably in <500 lines of Python.

Feel free to ask for deeper dives into any individual piece. Good luck with your project!

==== Message #5 ====
User: 
ok well let's start by creating the discord bot. what would be a good name for it? news something something

kotlin.Unit

==== Message #6 ====
Assistant: 
Here are a few naming ideas—short, memorable, and hinting at what the bot does (filtering + rating news paragraphs). Pick whichever “feels” right, or combine pieces to create your own:

1. NewsSieve
2. HeadlineHarvester
3. RelevanceRover
4. SentimentScout
5. PressParser
6. NewsLens
7. ArticleAntenna
8. LeadHighlight
9. NewsSpotlight
10. ContextCurator

Tips for choosing:

• Keep it 2–3 syllables so it’s easy to type in Discord commands (e.g., `!sieve help`).  
• Avoid generic words like just “NewsBot”—there are many of those.  
• Make sure the name isn’t already taken on Discord if you plan to host it publicly (search the bot list).  
• Check that the corresponding GitHub/project folder name is also available to keep things tidy.

Once you pick one, you can create the bot application in the Discord Developer Portal, assign the name, and grab its token—all set for coding the listener.

User: 
how can i give it permissions to view a channel and or DM people? 

kotlin.Unit

==== Message #8 ====
Assistant: 
Below is a concise, up-to-date checklist for granting your Discord bot the ability to  

• read / send messages in specific channels, and  
• exchange direct messages (DMs) with users.  

You do everything from Discord’s Developer Portal plus normal server permissions in Discord itself.

---

## 1. Create or open the bot application

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications  
2. “New Application” → name it (e.g., **NewsSieve**).  
3. In the left sidebar choose **Bot** → “Add Bot”.

---

## 2. Enable the required *privileged intents*

The code that listens for DMs or message content must have the correct *Gateway Intents*:

Bot tab → “Privileged Gateway Intents”:  

• **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** → *ON* (lets the bot read text, including DMs).  
• (Optional) **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT** if you’ll look up member data.

Click **Save Changes**.

---

## 3. Generate an invite (OAuth2) link with the right permissions

1. Left sidebar → **OAuth2 → URL Generator**.  
2. SCOPES: check **bot** (and **applications.commands** if you will add slash commands).  
3. BOT PERMISSIONS – at minimum:  
   • Read Messages / View Channels  
   • Send Messages  
   • Embed Links (if you’ll send rich embeds)  
   • Attach Files (if you might send images)  
   • (Optional) Add Reactions, Manage Messages, etc.  
4. Copy the URL shown at the bottom; visit it in your browser and select the server where you have “Administrator” permission.  
   The bot joins the server with those exact permissions.

Tip: The generated link encodes a “permission integer.” If you later add or remove permissions in the list, create a fresh link and reinvite.

---

## 4. Fine-tune per-channel access

Inside Discord (desktop / web client):

1. Right-click the target text channel → **Edit Channel** → **Permissions**.  
2. Add your bot’s role (Discord auto-creates one with the same name as the bot) if it isn’t listed.  
3. Grant or deny specific overrides:  
   • ✅ View Channel  
   • ✅ Send Messages  
   • ✅ Embed Links  
   • ❌ anything you want blocked (e.g., Manage Messages).  
4. Save.

The bot can now only read and post where allowed.

---

## 5. Allowing / receiving DMs

A bot can DM a user when **both** conditions are true:

1. The user shares at least one server with the bot **or** the user has previously DMed the bot (creating a mutual DM channel).  
2. The user’s privacy settings allow DMs from server members (default is on).

From the coding side:

• In `discord.py` you simply listen for `on_message` events where `message.guild is None` (DMs).  
• To *initiate* a DM, call `await user.send("text")`.

No extra permissions are needed beyond the intents you enabled earlier.

---

## 6. Testing

1. Start your bot locally (`python main.py`).  
2. In Discord, DM the bot or mention it in the channel you configured.  
3. Confirm that the event fires and your bot logs / replies.  
4. If something isn’t received:  
   • Check gateway intents (did you restart the bot after toggling them?).  
   • Verify channel overrides.  
   • Make sure the bot’s highest role outranks any deny rule.

That’s all you need for read/send privileges and DMs. Once those are confirmed working, you can move on to implementing the article-processing logic.

What’s next
1. Create the application & bot in the Discord Developer Portal (if you haven’t already) and copy its token into the `.env`.
2. Ensure you enabled **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** for the bot in the portal.
3. Invite the bot to your test server with at least “Read Messages / Send Messages” permissions.
4. Run `python main.py`, DM it a URL, or mention it in a channel followed by a URL, and you should see the acknowledgment.

After you confirm this flow works we can start integrating the article-fetching and analysis steps.

==== Message #12 ====
Assistant: 
You can think of a “channel having a role” in two different ways:

1. The role exists in the guild and can *see* / *post* in that channel (either through the default permissions or an explicit overwrite).  
2. The channel has an explicit permission overwrite for that role, regardless of what the overwrite actually does.

Here’s how to test both cases in `discord.py` 2.x.

```python
# python
from discord.utils import get

ROLE_NAME = "Newsulizer"

@bot.event
async def on_message(message: discord.Message) -> None:
    if message.guild is None:               # DM, ignore
        return

    # Grab the Role object by name
    role = get(message.guild.roles, name=ROLE_NAME)
    if role is None:
        # The role doesn't even exist in this server
        await message.channel.send(f"Role **{ROLE_NAME}** not found in this guild.")
        return

    # 1️⃣ Does that role have permission to view this channel?
    can_view = message.channel.permissions_for(role).view_channel
    if can_view:
        print(f"Role '{ROLE_NAME}' can view #{message.channel.name}")

    # 2️⃣ Does the channel define an explicit overwrite for this role?
    #    (Could be allow, deny, or neutral)
    overwrite = message.channel.overwrites_for(role)
    if overwrite.is_empty():          # no overwrite at all
        print(f"No explicit overwrite for '{ROLE_NAME}' in this channel.")
    else:
        print(f"Channel has an overwrite for '{ROLE_NAME}': {overwrite}")
```

Explanation of the key calls:

• `discord.utils.get(message.guild.roles, name="Newsulizer")`  
  – Fetches the `Role` object by its display name.

• `message.channel.permissions_for(role)`  
  – Combines base role permissions, category inheritance, and channel-specific overwrites; useful when you just want to know “can that role see or post here?”.  
  – Access flags like `.view_channel`, `.send_messages`, etc.

• `message.channel.overwrites_for(role)`  
  – Returns the *explicit* permission overwrite for that role in this channel (may be all `None` if no custom rules).  
  – Use `.is_empty()` to check whether any explicit allow/deny is set.

Pick whichever test matches your intent; usually #1 is enough if you simply need to know whether users with “Newsulizer” privileges can interact in the channel.

User: 
what's that tool that can download webpages by simulating a full headless browser? i think it was made by microsoft or something. I need it because news articles tend to be very protective 

kotlin.Unit

==== Message #14 ====
Assistant: 
The tool you’re thinking of is almost certainly **Playwright**.  
It’s an open-source browser-automation framework originally created by Microsoft that lets you drive Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit in either headed or headless mode—perfect for grabbing the fully rendered HTML of pay-walled or JS-heavy news sites.

Why Playwright fits your use-case
• Maintained by Microsoft, wide community, frequent releases.  
• Ships its own, patched browser builds, so you don’t have to install Chrome system-wide.  
• One API for Chromium, Firefox, WebKit—handy if a site blocks one engine.  
• First-class Python bindings, asyncio-friendly.  
• Supports stealth features (device emulation, user-agent changes, extra HTTP headers, proxy, etc.).

---

Quick start in Python

```bash
pip install playwright
python -m playwright install    # downloads the three browsers
```

```python
# python
import asyncio
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def fetch_html(url: str) -> str:
    async with async_playwright() as pw:
        browser = await pw.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        context = await browser.new_context()
        page = await context.new_page()

        # optional: set extra headers, user-agent, cookies, …
        await page.goto(url, wait_until="networkidle")
        html = await page.content()

        await browser.close()
        return html

if __name__ == "__main__":
    html_source = asyncio.run(fetch_html("https://example.com"))
    print(html_source[:500])
```

Tips for scraping news sites with Playwright
1. Use `wait_until="networkidle"` or manually `await page.wait_for_load_state("networkidle")` to ensure lazy-loaded text is present.  
2. Spoof a realistic user-agent and viewport:  
   ```python
   context = await browser.new_context(
       user_agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)…",
       viewport={"width": 1280, "height": 800},
   )
   ```  
3. For hard paywalls, log in once with `context.storage_state(path="state.json")` and reuse the state file in future sessions.  
4. If a site detects headless Chrome, launch with:  
   ```python
   browser = await pw.chromium.launch(headless=True, args=["--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled"])
   ```  
5. Respect robots.txt / TOS, add delays, and cache pages so you’re not hammering servers.

Alternatives (for completeness)
• Puppeteer (Node.js, by Google) – similar concept but JS-only.  
• Selenium + ChromeDriver/GeckoDriver – heavyweight, older API.  
• Splash (headless QtWebKit via HTTP) – good for Lua scripts, Docker only.  
Playwright is generally the most ergonomic choice for modern Python projects.

Once you’ve verified Playwright can fetch the article HTML, you can plug `fetch_html` into your Discord bot’s `handle_article_url` coroutine, extract the text (BeautifulSoup, readability-lxml, etc.), then run your NLP pipeline.

kotlin.Unit

User: 
would it make more sense to cache the broswer and or context object?

kotlin.Unit

==== Message #16 ====
Assistant: 
Yes—spinning-up a Playwright browser is the most expensive part of each fetch (it has to start a full, sandboxed Chromium/Firefox/WebKit process).  
Keeping one Browser object alive and re-using it for many page loads typically divides your latency by ~3-5× and saves a lot of CPU.

What to cache, in practice:

1. Browser (always)  
   • Launch it once at program start.  
   • Close it once on shutdown.  

2. Context (depends)  
   • Re-use one context if every request can share the same cookies / local-storage and you don’t care about cross-site leakage.  
   • Create–and-close a **new** context per logical session when you need clean storage, different proxies, or different authentication.

A common pattern for a Discord bot or queue worker:

```python
# python
import asyncio
from typing import Optional
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright, Browser, BrowserContext, Page

class PlaywrightPool:
    _pw = None           # playwright instance
    _browser: Optional[Browser] = None
    _ctx: Optional[BrowserContext] = None
    _sema: asyncio.Semaphore  # limit parallel pages

    @classmethod
    async def start(cls, max_concurrency: int = 4) -> None:
        if cls._pw is not None:
            return                                    # already started

        cls._pw = await async_playwright().start()
        cls._browser = await cls._pw.chromium.launch(
            headless=True,
            args=["--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled"],
        )
        cls._ctx = await cls._browser.new_context(
            user_agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...",
            viewport={"width": 1280, "height": 800},
        )
        cls._sema = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrency)

    @classmethod
    async def stop(cls) -> None:
        if cls._ctx:
            await cls._ctx.close()
        if cls._browser:
            await cls._browser.close()
        if cls._pw:
            await cls._pw.stop()

    @classmethod
    async def fetch_html(cls, url: str) -> str:
        if cls._browser is None:
            await cls.start()

        async with cls._sema:                       # throttle concurrency
            page: Page = await cls._ctx.new_page()
            try:
                await page.goto(url, wait_until="networkidle")
                html = await page.content()
                return html
            finally:
                await page.close()
```

How this helps
• Only one Chromium process stays resident.  
• Each `new_page()` is cheap (tens of ms).  
• Semaphore prevents you from opening too many tabs at once and exhausting RAM.

When a **new context per job** makes sense
• Site A needs a logged-in pay-wall cookie; site B must stay anonymous.  
• You want to rotate proxies / user-agents per request.  
In that case:

```python
async with cls._browser.new_context(proxy={"server": "socks5://…"}) as ctx:
    page = await ctx.new_page()
    ...
```

but still keep the single Browser alive.

Remember to close the browser on program exit. In an async app you can hook this into `bot.close()` or an `atexit` callback.

So: cache the Browser; optionally cache one context; always create fresh Page objects.

# Scripts

General useful scripts (mostly for Linux)

# dns_fetch.py
---
This lovely python script allows you to fetch ip address form cloudflare dns records. This is useful for remote servers with dynamic ips you wish to keep private. Pretty nifty eh?
## Env file
---
The script searches for a file named `dns_resolv_env.json` in:
- your home directory (`~/`)
- the config folder (`~/.local/share/dns_helper/`)
- the local folder (`./`)
- the parent folder (`../`)
The file is a json file with 3 possible attributes
```
{
        "auth_key": "key here",
        "zone_id": "zone id here",
        "default_name": "website name here"
}
```
### Notes
---
- The env file and its arguments are optional.
- If no auth key is specified, the script will require you to pass your auth key with `--auth "key here"`
- Zone id can be provided via the commandline arg `--zone` or in the env file.
- If no zone id is provided the script will fetch and print from ALL zones on your cloudflare account.
- If default_name is not specified by either file or via `-n "name"`, filtering will be ignored.
- Commandline args are always prefered.
## Usage Examples
---
- `python3 dns_fetch.py -a -n -i` 
    - Returns only the ip address of the A record corresponding to default_name.
        - This can be used in bash commands: `ssh username@$(python3 dns_fetch.py -a -n -i)`
- `python3 dns_fetch.py -a` 
    - Returns all A records
- `python3 dns_fetch.py -c`
    - Returns all CNAME records
- `python3 dns_fetch.py`
    - Prints the raw json from cloudflare
- `python3 dns_fetch.py -n`
    - Prints all records corresponding to default_name

# site_gen.py
---
Allows you to easily generate and install nginx site configs.

==== Message #18 ====
Assistant: 
Below is one possible wiring that shows the **minimum** you have to add to `main.py`
so you can call `PlaywrightPool.fetch_html()` from inside
`handle_article_url`.

Step 1 – drop the pool class into its own module  
(create a new file named `playwright_pool.py` in the same folder):

```python
# python
"""
playwright_pool.py – singleton wrapper around Playwright

pip install playwright
python -m playwright install
"""
import asyncio
from typing import Optional

from playwright.async_api import async_playwright, Browser, BrowserContext, Page


class PlaywrightPool:
    _pw = None
    _browser: Optional[Browser] = None
    _ctx: Optional[BrowserContext] = None
    _sema: Optional[asyncio.Semaphore] = None

    @classmethod
    async def start(cls, max_concurrency: int = 4) -> None:
        if cls._browser:                # already started
            return

        cls._pw = await async_playwright().start()

        cls._browser = await cls._pw.chromium.launch(
            headless=True,
            args=["--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled"],
        )

        cls._ctx = await cls._browser.new_context(
            user_agent=(
                "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) "
                "AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) "
                "Chrome/137.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
            ),
            viewport={"width": 1280, "height": 800},
        )

        cls._sema = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrency)

    @classmethod
    async def stop(cls) -> None:
        if cls._ctx:
            await cls._ctx.close()
        if cls._browser:
            await cls._browser.close()
        if cls._pw:
            await cls._pw.stop()

    @classmethod
    async def fetch_html(cls, url: str, wait_state: str = "networkidle") -> str:
        if cls._browser is None:        # lazy-bootstrap
            await cls.start()

        async with cls._sema:
            page: Page = await cls._ctx.new_page()
            try:
                await page.goto(url, wait_until=wait_state)
                return await page.content()
            finally:
                await page.close()
```

Step 2 – import & use the pool in `main.py`

<llm-snippet-file>main.py</llm-snippet-file>
```python
# [...] keep previous imports
from playwright_pool import PlaywrightPool   # ← new import

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Discord event handlers
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

@bot.event
async def on_ready() -> None:
    LOGGER.info("Logged in as %s (id=%s)", bot.user, bot.user.id)
    # start the headless browser once Discord is connected
    await PlaywrightPool.start()
    LOGGER.info("Playwright pool ready")
    LOGGER.info("------")


@bot.event
async def on_message(message: discord.Message) -> None:
    # (existing filter logic) [...]

    # Launch the article-processing task
    asyncio.create_task(handle_article_url(message, url))


# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Helper coroutine that now fetches article HTML
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

async def handle_article_url(message: discord.Message, url: str) -> None:
    LOGGER.info("Received URL from %s: %s", message.author, url)

    try:
        html = await PlaywrightPool.fetch_html(url)
        # TODO: parse `html`, summarise, etc.
        await message.channel.send(f"✅ Article downloaded – {len(html):,} bytes.")
    except Exception as exc:
        LOGGER.exception("Playwright failed")
        await message.channel.send("❌ Sorry, I couldn't fetch that page.")


# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Entrypoint (make sure we stop the browser on shutdown)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

def main() -> None:
    if DISCORD_TOKEN == "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE":
        raise RuntimeError("Set the DISCORD_TOKEN environment variable.")

    try:
        bot.run(DISCORD_TOKEN)
    finally:
        # If the process exits (Ctrl-C, exception, etc.) close Playwright cleanly
        asyncio.run(PlaywrightPool.stop())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

How this works
• `PlaywrightPool.start()` is called once in `on_ready`, keeping a single
  Chromium instance alive.  
• Every time `handle_article_url` is invoked it runs
  `PlaywrightPool.fetch_html(url)` which:  
  – creates a fresh tab (page),  
  – navigates, waits for the network to go idle,  
  – returns the fully-rendered HTML,  
  – closes the tab.  
• A semaphore inside the pool limits concurrent tabs so you don’t exhaust RAM.  
• When the bot process shuts down, `PlaywrightPool.stop()` is invoked from the
  `finally:` block in `main()`, ensuring the browser exits cleanly.

That’s all you need to start fetching and processing news articles with a
headless browser while keeping startup latency low and resource usage under
control.

==== Message #19 ====
User: 
how can i split a string into messages which is less than 4000 in length? preferrably at sentence boundaries. this limit is a hard limit!

alternatively how can i send it as a attached markdown file?

kotlin.Unit

==== Message #20 ====
Assistant: 
Below are two common approaches you can drop straight into your Discord bot:

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1.  Split a long string into ≤ 4000-character messages  
   – tries to break on sentence boundaries first  
2.  Fall back to sending the whole thing as an attached Markdown file
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

### 1. Splitting helper

```python
# python
import re
from typing import List

DISCORD_LIMIT = 4000          # hard limit you mentioned

sentence_re = re.compile(r"(?<=[.!?])\s+")   # split on . ? ! followed by space


def split_into_messages(text: str, limit: int = DISCORD_LIMIT) -> List[str]:
    """
    Returns a list of chunks, each ≤ limit characters.
    Preference:
        1. Try to end on a sentence boundary.
        2. If a single sentence itself exceeds the limit,
           hard-wrap that sentence at exactly `limit`.
    """
    sentences = sentence_re.split(text)
    messages: List[str] = []
    buf = ""

    for sentence in sentences:
        # +1 for the space we'll re-insert
        if len(buf) + len(sentence) + 1 <= limit:
            buf += sentence + " "
            continue

        # current buffer would overflow -> flush it
        if buf:
            messages.append(buf.rstrip())
            buf = ""

        # the sentence alone is too big → hard-slice
        while len(sentence) > limit:
            messages.append(sentence[:limit])
            sentence = sentence[limit:]

        buf = sentence + " "

    if buf:
        messages.append(buf.rstrip())

    return messages
```

Usage inside a command / event:

```python
# python
text = generate_very_long_string()

for chunk in split_into_messages(text):
    await message.channel.send(chunk)
```

What it does  
• Splits on a regex that looks for `.`, `?`, or `!` followed by whitespace.  
• Accumulates sentences until adding the next one would exceed the limit.  
• If a single sentence is longer than 4000 characters (rare, but possible),
  it slices that sentence hard at the limit.

Feel free to replace the regex with something more sophisticated (e.g. `nltk`
or `spacy` sentence tokenisation) if you need better language handling.

---

### 2. Sending the whole text as an attached Markdown file

Sometimes users prefer a file for easy downloading or when the text would
become dozens of messages. Discord lets you attach a file of up to **25 MiB**
without Nitro.

```python
# python
import io
import discord

async def send_markdown_file(channel: discord.abc.Messageable, content: str, filename: str = "article.md") -> None:
    fp = io.BytesIO(content.encode("utf-8"))
    file = discord.File(fp, filename=filename)
    await channel.send("📄 Full article attached:", file=file)
```

Call it like:

```python
await send_markdown_file(message.channel, long_markdown_string)
```

Benefits  
• One message instead of many.  
• Users can open it in their preferred editor with full Markdown syntax
  preserved.  
• Bypasses the 4000-character message limit entirely.

---

Pick whichever approach fits the situation:  
• Short–medium output → split into multiple nice messages.  
• Huge walls of text → attach as `*.md`.
